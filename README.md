## Perfect For Boostrapped Startups & Hacky Engineers :nerd_face:
We love Woocommerce & Squarespace! But vendor lock-in and zero code access isn't for everyone.

With Veniqa, you have choices.
* Launch yourself
* Get a premium support package
* Use the codebase for other projects

---

## The Suite :package:
* API Server for Shopping Applications
* API Server for Management Applications
* Web Client for Shoppers
* Web Client for Management

---

## Few Things Under The Hood :factory:

### Built using the MEVN Stack & The Usual Suspects
MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js, Mongoose ORM, Redis, Sendgrid, Nodemailer (for fallback), Stripe.

### Performant & Secure - cause we like it that way
* Distributed requests utilizing all system cores, 
* Encrypted authentication and sessions, 
* Backend equipped with request rate limiting to prevent scripted attacks and bot crawling, 
* Database & file-based logging.

### Built for the Cloud, with developers in mind
* CD/CI friendly codebase and configuration setup, 
* Simplified dev-prod and local-cloud switches, 
* Docker scripts, 
* AWS S3 Integration for cheap image storage.

### Granular controls
* Drag-and-drop design builders for home page customizations, 
* Image Editor to edit and preview product images and thumbnails, 
* Order tracking at a line item level, 
* Tariff support for international shipments, 
* Payment accepted in multiple digital forms and currencies powered by Stripe.
